This deploy project is a tiny BASH framework to quickly and automatically get Gentoo 10.1 64-bit up and running after deployment. The scripts in the modules folder are run in numerical order in order to get the server completely updated, as well as install additional settings/packages, all automatically.

This is designed specifically for use by SourceKills with Slicehost.

To use it, run the following as root on a brand new, freshly installed Gentoo slice:

wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/tsuehpsyde/SourceKills/tarball/master
tar xzvf tsuehpsyde-SourceKills*.tar.gz
bash tsuehpsyde-SourceKills*/sys_scripts/deploy/deploy.sh

The goal is to keep this modular enough that each step is broken down, and hopefully, this can be expanded to work with regular servers as well.
