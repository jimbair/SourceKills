The numbering scheme on the modules is as follows.
There are examples in ()'s of things to do during those stages.
Modules are executed in numerical order from lowest to highest.

000-099 - Basic, initial config file setup (setup make.conf)
100-199 - OS Level Changes (update portage/packages)
200-299 - Install additional applications
300-399 - Setup users
400-499 - Application Configuration (like apache)
800-899 - Personal Preference Configuration (such as vim)
900-999 - Cleanup (revdep rebuild, package rebuilds, distfile cleanup)

All modules should check so that, if re-run, they don't do extra work, break things by double-configuring, etc.

This is done so that this can be more modular for other purposes outside of SourceKills or myself. Also, maintaining modules is far easier than one huge script.
