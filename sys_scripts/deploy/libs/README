All of the files in this folder are library modules. If you find yourself doing
the same this across more than one module, you should probably make a function
that goes in here and can be used globally.

Rules:

- Only functions allowed! Nothing else!
- Each library file must have a '.sh' extension.
- Each library file must export it's function.
- Only one function per library file.

The last rule is because troubleshooting a ton of BASH functions is no fun.
Breaking a single function is much easier to diagnose/fix. Trust me. =)
